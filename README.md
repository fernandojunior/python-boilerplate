# python-boilerplate

Collection of my boilerplates for Python.

* [module](https://github.com/fernandojunior/python-boilerplate-module) - A boilerplate to create a Python module based project.
* [package](https://github.com/fernandojunior/python-boilerplate-package) - A boilerplate to create a Python package based project.
* [script](https://github.com/fernandojunior/python-boilerplate-script) - A boilerplate to create a Python script based project.

## Features
*Common preconfigured tools to facilitate the project development.*

* [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.org/) - Code coverage measurement.
* [Flake8](https://flake8.readthedocs.org/) - The modular source code checker: pep8, pyflakes and co.
* [pytest](http://pytest.org/) - A mature full-featured Python testing tool.
* [setuptools](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html) - Easily download, build, install, upgrade, and uninstall distribution packages.
* [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/) - Auto builds and tests distributions in multiple Python versions using virtualenvs.

## Glossary
*Terms to understand the capabilities offered by the boilerplates.*

* `build` - Refers to preparing a project in a `distribution package` that users can install and use easily.
* `dependency` - A `distribution package` that is required to `build`, install and use a `project`.
* `distribution package` - A archive file with `packages`, `modules` or other resources used to distribute a `release`.
* `module` - A .py file that serves as a unit of Python source code which can expose variables, functions and classes.
* `package` - A directory containing an \_\_init\_\_.py file and which can contain `modules` or recursively, other `packages`.
* `pip` - The preferred package manager system for installing `distribution packages`.
* `project` - A library, framework, script, plugin, application, or other resources or some combination thereof.
* `release` - A snapshot of a `project` at a particular point in time, denoted by a version identifier.
* `virtualenv` - A tool to isolate a environment of a `project` and its `dependencies` from a Python installation.
